# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

    - Very confident! They make complete sense. I do know that I will never learn all of them by heart.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

    - Very confident. It makes a lot of sense to define exactly what something should do. We have complete control!

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

    - I am curious how developers further along use methods. Do they have a few that are their go-tos, or do they just look up all different ones they need? Methods are capable of pretty much anything you want them to be, as long as you have the wherewithal to write the code within the method.
